==============

A command line implementation of the game Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe.

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a variation of Tic-Tac-Toe where each square on the board contains another Tic-Tac-Toe board. To mark your symbol on the larger board, one must successfully create a three-in-a-row line in one of the smaller boards. However, the move a player makes is restricted based on the square their opponent made a move in.
